Understand and utilize JupyterLab for managing Python-based data science projects. Learn and apply data preprocessing and engineering techniques. Gain proficiency in building and training basic neural networks for image classification using the MNIST dataset. Advance to creating and optimizing Convolutional Neural Networks 
This project encompasses a series of deep learning modules designed to impart a practical understanding of neural networks, with a focus on image classification tasks. The project begins with an introduction to JupyterLab, a popular development environment for Python and data science, then proceeds to the "Hello World" of deep learning â€” classifying handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

The project objectives expand to include understanding how deep learning solves problems that defy traditional programming methods, data preprocessing techniques, and creating and training neural network models. A key aspect of the project is the transition from simple neural networks to more sophisticated Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are particularly adept at image recognition tasks. The project applies CNNs to classify images from the American Sign Language (ASL) dataset, addressing challenges like overfitting and enhancing model performance through architecture improvements.

Practical exercises using TensorFlow and Keras form a significant part of the learning experience, offering hands-on experience in building, training, and evaluating models. The course also delves into data augmentation techniques to improve model performance by increasing and diversifying the training data.
